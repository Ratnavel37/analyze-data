# Traffic Accident Data Analysis and Hotspot Visualization

## Project Overview

This project analyzes traffic accident data to identify patterns and contributing factors such as road conditions, weather, and time of day. Additionally, it visualizes accident hotspots using geospatial data, allowing for a better understanding of locations with a high density of accidents. The analysis provides insights into accident trends and supports decision-making for improving road safety.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Handles missing values and prepares the dataset for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizes relationships between road conditions, weather, time of day, and accident frequency.
- **Accident Hotspot Visualization**: Maps accident hotspots using geographic data (latitude and longitude) with a heatmap.
- **Insights into Contributing Factors**: Analyzes key factors like road surface conditions and weather to identify the most frequent causes of accidents.

## Dataset

The dataset used contains information about traffic accidents with attributes such as:
- **Time**
- **Day of the week**
- **Age and sex of the driver**
- **Road conditions, weather conditions**
- **Type of vehicle**
- **Accident severity**
- **Cause of the accident**
  
In some cases, geographical information (latitude and longitude) is also included to visualize accident hotspots.

## Requirements

The project requires the following Python libraries:

- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **seaborn**: For data visualization (bar plots, histograms).
- **matplotlib**: For creating static visualizations.
- **folium**: For generating interactive maps with heatmaps.
- **jupyterlab**: (Optional) For running the project in an interactive notebook environment.

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib folium jupyterlab
```

## How to Run

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**:
   Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/traffic-accident-analysis.git
   cd traffic-accident-analysis
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Install the necessary Python libraries by running:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Analysis**:
   Run the Python script to perform the analysis and generate visualizations:

   ```bash
   python accident_analysis.py
   ```

4. **View Hotspot Map**:
   If latitude and longitude data is available in the dataset, you can view the generated heatmap by opening `accident_hotspots.html` in a web browser.

## Data Visualization

The project includes several visualizations to explore traffic accident data:

- **Accidents by Road Surface Conditions**
- **Accidents by Weather Conditions**
- **Accidents by Time of Day**
- **Heatmap of Accident Hotspots** (if geospatial data is available)

## Conclusion

This project provides valuable insights into accident trends, which can assist in improving road safety. It visualizes accident-prone areas and helps identify the main contributing factors to accidents such as road and weather conditions.

## Future Work

- Expand analysis to include more advanced machine learning models for predicting accident severity.
- Incorporate additional datasets with more detailed geographic or traffic data.
